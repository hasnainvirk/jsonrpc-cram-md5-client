[Toolchain, Workstation, Test Info]: Cross GCC, has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 machine with GCC 5.04

## General Information

This code base provides a CRAM-MD5 Authentication process with Tossibox server using JSON RPC 2.0 calls with 
Netstring transport mechanism. 
Code base might not be portable to Windows OS as the Client logic is using some linux specific helper calls. 
Its not tested on Windows at all.
Originally Eclipse IDE was used to develop the project. However, later on a project specific makefile was added
to facilitate command line build and execute.
If you happen to use Eclipse IDE, you have three choices: (if hopefully you get the project settings, i.e., .settings folder)

1) Debug Build option
2) Release Build option
3) custom-make build option

The first too are eclipse provided automated build options. Third one uses our custom make file.

Otherwise, all you need is a good old linux machine with gcc installed and a nasty little box providing internet.
 
## How to Solve Assignment ?

1) $make 
2) ./ASSIGNMENT

## Building a test build for individual module testing ?

1) make clean
2) make TEST=1
3) ./ASSIGNMENT

## Generating documentation ?

1) doxygen doxy //assuming you have doxygen installed
2) firefox docs/html/index.html


Happy bug hunting.
